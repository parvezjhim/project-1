                <p>"17 years ago, in a galaxy real, real close… Planet Earth has declassified Pluto as a planet. Unbeknownst to the Earthlings, this made the Plutonians furious. Hero:”Why did I become a captain for the Space Force we haven’t fought any aliens! Should have joined the damn Nav…”
                    SUDDEN EXPLOSION, GROUND SHAKES. YOU HEAR WHAT SOUNDS LIKE THE VOICE OF GOD.
                     “ATTENTION ALL HUMANS, SEVERAL YEARS AGO YOU DECLASSIFIED OUR HOME AS A PLANET, WE PLUTONIANS ARE HERE FOR REVENGE! LET’S SEE IF EARTH IS STILL CLASSIFIED AS A PLANET AFTER WE ARE DONE WIT IT!”
                    Your mission should you choose to accept is it to defend the Earth while piloting the U.S.S Razer Crest and it’s laser firing system. You will have to defeat all the enemies on the screen while the Boss ship hurtles across the screen trying to crash into you. Dodge the enemies and defeat them or all hope for Earth is lost. Godspeed Captain.
