PLUTO ATTACKS
Story time
You are a captain of the Space Force and are bored out of your mind while speaking to a solider:

Captain: “Man why did I become a captain for the space force, we haven’t fought ANY aliens yet! Should’ve joined the damn Nav….

*SUDDEN EXPLOSION”

*GROUND SHAKES*

*YOU HEAR WHAT SOUNDS LIKE THE VOICE OF GOD”

ATTENTION ALL HUMANS, SEVERAL YEARS AGO YOU DECLASSIFIED OUR BEAUTIFUL HOME AS A PLANET! WE PLUTONIANS TOOK THIS TO HEART AND HAVE BEEN PLANNING AN ACT OF WAR OF VERY LONG! LET’S SEE IF EARTH IS STILL CLASSIFIED AS A PLANET AFTER WE ARE DONE WITH IT!

Captain:”Well shit, here we gooo!”

Your goal as the captain of the space force is to defend Earth from the plutonian invaders. You will have to fight through their 5 enemy ships to get to the big boss ship and defeat it. You have bullets, missiles and an engineer on board who can help repair your ship.

You will battle each ship one at a time, and progress to the next one as you defeat them. If you are destroyed all hope for the planet is lost and the plutonians will be our new alien overlords.

You can use the fire function at anytime, i will set an accuracy key value pair in the object that will determine how often you will hit them 
The missile function can’t be used everytime and will cause more damage to enemy hull
When the ship fires there should be a little flame that appear and disappears in front of the ship
When you defeat all enemy ships you will face a boss that does more damage and has more health
